        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>This website is created by BSIT 4BG1, Bulacan State University A.Y. 2024 - 2025 to promote youth engagement and community involvement.</p>
        
        <h3>Mission</h3>
        <p>Our mission is to help youth express their thoughts to SK Officials and to assist in making their barangay better.</p>
        <p>We believe that youth are the foundation of a thriving community, and their future is crucial to our collective success. By understanding the challenges they face and the reasons for their limited participation in Barangay activities, SK officials can gain valuable insights into the needs and concerns of the youth. This understanding will empower them to implement effective solutions that promote greater youth engagement and active participation within the community.</p>
